Uninformed Search - Pacman
=============================

### Problem Statement

Teach Pacman how to intelligently find his food. The objective of this task is to simulate
breadth-first search, depth-first search, and DFID in the state space. The state-space consists of
an m x n grid. The start state is (0,0). The goal state is the position of (*) in the grid. The
Pacman is allowed to move UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT (except for boundary).

* Contains brief description of variables, functions and data structures used in the code

* Pseudo code for movegen and goaltest function

* Results for sample test case

* Comparision among BFS, DFS and DFID

* Dependancy of order of neighbors

----------------------------------

### Steps for execution 

#### Input 

> Add *input.txt* in the same directory

#### Input Format

* *line 1 :* 0, 1 or 2 (respectively for bfs, dfs or dfid)

* *line 2 :* m x n maze with food for packman

----------------------------------

#### Output 

> Writes result in *output.txt*

#### Output Format

* *line 1 :* Number of states explored in first line

* *line 2 :* Length of the path discovered in second line

* *line 3 :* m x n maze with path printed in '0's.
