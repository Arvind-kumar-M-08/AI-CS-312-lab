Input :
	Program reads "input.txt"
	which contains :
		- Two spaced integers in the first line (0,1 for BFS or Hillclimbing) (0,1,2 heuristic function).
		- Three lines for start state(each stack in one line) where left to right is bottom to top of stack(Each character should be spaced).		Next Three lines similarly for Goal state.


Output :
	Program prints output in "output.txt"
	which contains :
		- If goal state is reached or not.
		- Final reached state's stack in three lines.
		- Number of states explored.
		- Time taken in seconds.
