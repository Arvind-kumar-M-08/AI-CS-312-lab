----------------------------------

## Lab 1 - Uninformed search 

Finding path for pacman in a grid using Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and DFID and comparing their efficiency with time of execution and states explored.

## Lab 2 - Heuristic Search Algorithms

Searching goal state for Block World Domain game using Best First Search and hill climbing for 3 different heuristics. Then comparing their efficiency in terms of time and space taken.

## Lab 3 - Heuristic Search Algorithms

Generating uniform random 4-SAT for *n* variables and *k* clauses. Then using Variable Neighborhood Descent, Beam Search and Tabu search to find if there exist a solution and analyzing their performace for various parameters.

## Lab 4 - Travelling Salesman Problem

Finding optimal tour for Travelling Salesman Problem using greedy, Ant Colony Optimization, 2 cities exchange within a given time for both euclidean and non-euclidean graph.

## Lab 5 - Game Playing

Returning next optimal move for any given configuration for the game *Othello* using Minimax algorithm and Alpha beta pruning using some heuristics. Then comparing the both bots with each other and random move bot.

## Lab 6 - Support Vector Machine

Building Email spam classifier using sklearn SVM with different kernels (rbf, Quadratic and Linear) and finding optimal value of penalty parameter for each kernel.
